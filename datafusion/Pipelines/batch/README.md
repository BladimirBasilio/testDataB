# Batch Pipelines in Data Fusion

Creating and deploying batch pipelines in [Google Cloud Data Fusion](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion)

## Getting Started

Data Fusion is a fully-managed, no-code data integration platform at any scale.

### Prerequisites

In order to have a local development environment for Data Studio, it's advisable to deploy a local CDAP Sandbox, following [this guide](https://medium.com/cdapio/develop-locally-deploy-globally-9124727878cd)

### Testing the pipelines

Once you have your testing enviroment set up, yo can import the pipelines on this repo to test them.

## Deployment

Once tested locally, you can import the pipelines in Data Fusion using the same procedure used for the local CDAP Sandbox.
